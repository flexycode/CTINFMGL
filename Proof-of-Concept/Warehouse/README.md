# Warehouse Supply Chain Management System Technical Design Document

## Introduction
- 	Purpose: Outline the database architecture for a Warehouse Supply Chain Management System.
- 	Scope: Focus on database design using Microsoft SQL Server.
- 	Audience: Developers, database administrators, and project stakeholders.

## System Overview
### •	Architecture: 
- o	Client Tier: Web application for user interaction.
- o	Server Tier: SQL Server database for data management.
- o	Scalability: Design for future growth and potential transition to Tier 3 architecture.

## Database Architecture

### •	Data Modeling: 
- o	Entities: Products, suppliers, customers, orders, shipments, inventory, locations.
- o	Normalization: Reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
### •	Indexing: Optimize query performance for frequently accessed data.
•	Security: 
- o	User authentication and authorization.
- o	Data encryption.
### •	Backup and Recovery: 
- o	Full backups with incremental backups for disaster recovery.
### •	Performance Tuning: 
- o	Monitor query execution plans.
- o	Use resource monitoring tools.
### •	Data Integration: 
- o	Integrate with ERP systems and third-party APIs.

# Database Diagram
### •	ER Diagram: Visual representation of the data model.
### •	Database Schema: 
o	Tables, columns, data types, and relationships.
o	Consider storage, indexing, and partitioning strategies.

## Security Considerations
•	User Authentication: Implement secure login mechanisms.
•	Role-Based Access Control: Define user roles and permissions.

## Testing Strategy
•	Performance Testing: Ensure efficient data access and query performance.
•	Security Testing: Validate authentication and encryption measures.

## Deployment Plan
•	Environment Setup: Configure SQL Server and related infrastructure.
•	Data Migration: Plan for data import from existing systems.

## Maintenance and Support
•	Monitoring: Regularly check database performance and security.
•	Updates: Plan for schema changes and software updates.
